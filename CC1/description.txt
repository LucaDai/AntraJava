Coding Challenge 1 - SongCache:
getTopNSongsPlayed method:
Create an array of ArrayLists to bucket sort elements inside the hashmap.
Then loop from the end of the array to find the non-empty ArrayList and add songId to the result ArrayList to achieve the descending order.
count down n at the same time, return result ArrayList if n becomes 0.
Time complexity: O(N) + O(n)
Using synchronized to achieve thread-safe.

Having some problems running the test...
